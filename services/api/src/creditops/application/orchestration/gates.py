"""Deterministic human-gate derivation.

Only ``G1_INTAKE_COMPLETE`` is derived by the engine — satisfied by the presence
of the intake handoff.  Every other gate reflects its stored status and stays
OPEN until an authorized human records a disposition; the orchestrator never
satisfies or bypasses them.  This pure function is shared by the read-only
status view and the advance use case so both agree on the effective gate state.

``derive_g3_status`` mirrors the G1 pattern for ``G3_RISK_DISPOSITION``: a
pure, deterministic derivation of whether the gate MAY become SATISFIED, kept
entirely separate from who is allowed to act on it.  Unlike G1 (derived and
written by the engine from a handoff), G3 is derived here but WRITTEN only by
the human-facing disposition API (``api/risk_review.py``) after it records a
disposition — never by the Independent Risk Review Agent itself.  The checker
processor never imports or calls this function.

``G2_GAP_REQUEST_APPROVAL`` is NO LONGER derived here.  It is the pre-Risk
Evidence-Gap workflow gate (the ``HG_OUTBOUND_REQUEST_APPROVED`` capability,
master design section 9): it is derived ONLY from a ``GapRequestBatch`` plus a
human disposition, by ``domain/gap_request_batches.derive_g2_from_batch``, and
WRITTEN only by ``api/gap_requests.py``.  It no longer references the credit-ops
package in any way -- the old package-based G2 derivation and its credit-ops
writer have both been deleted, which is what breaks the
Risk-waits-on-Credit-Operations cycle.  ``INDEPENDENT_RISK_REVIEW`` still gates
on the STORED G2 status for the case version (readiness.py reads whatever is
stored, regardless of which endpoint wrote it), so a satisfied G2 recorded from
a batch disposition -- with zero credit-ops packages anywhere -- makes Risk
ready.

``derive_g4_status`` keeps the Credit Operations pattern for G4
(``G4_OPS_AUTHORIZATION``, action authorization): derived here, WRITTEN only by
``api/credit_ops.py`` after it records a human authorization record -- never by
the Credit Operations Agent's worker processor.  ``ensure_gate`` is an
idempotent insert-if-absent-then-satisfy-only-if-OPEN write, so an additional
writer for the same gate type is always safe.
