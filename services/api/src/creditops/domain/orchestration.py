"""Orchestration domain vocabulary: task types, human gates, derived readiness.

These enums name the finite sets the deterministic task-graph engine reasons
over.  Per ADR-0001 the engine — not the LLM planner — is the sole authority
over state.  Readiness is DERIVED from dependency completion, blocking evidence
gaps, human-gate status, and case-version currency; it is never stored as a
mutable column.  Queue messages carry only identifiers, so nothing here holds a
document body, finding, or secret.
